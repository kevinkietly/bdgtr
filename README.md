# Budget Planner

Budget Planner is an application that helps you create budgets and track your spending. I am designing it for people 
with financial goals. This project is of interest to me because many budgeting applications require a subscription to 
access certain features. Not everyone with financial goals has the money to pay for subscriptions, so I want to develop 
a free application with these features.

## Features

Create **unlimited**:

* accounts
* budgets
* custom categories
* transactions

View:

* all budgets
* total spending
* budget breakdown
* transaction history
