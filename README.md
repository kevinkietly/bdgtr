# Budget Planner

Budget Planner is an application that helps you create budgets and track your expenses. It is designed for people who
want to manage their money and plan their finances to reach their financial goals. This project is of interest to me
because I want to develop a program that I will use myself. While budgeting apps already exist, I want to challenge
myself by creating one from scratch and potentially add features that existing budgeting apps do not have.

## Features

* Create monthly budgets
* Add categories to budgets
* Add expenses to categories
* View history of expenses
* View amount spent and balance remaining
